# This is the modified common-password file for Debian-based distributions       #

# /etc/pam.d/common-password - password-related modules common to all services
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of modules that define the services to be
# used to change user passwords.  The default is pam_unix.

# here are the per-package modules (the "Primary" block)
password  required                    pam_pwquality.so minclass=4 minlen=15
password  [success=1 default=ignore]  pam_unix.so obscure sha256 use_auth_tok try_first_pass remember=3

# here's the fallback if no module succeeds
password	requisite			pam_deny.so

# prime the stack with a positive return value if there isn't one already;
# this avoids us returning an error just because nothing sets a success code
# since the modules above will each just jump around
password	required			pam_permit.so

# and here are more per-package modules (the "Additional" block)
# end of pam-auth-update config
