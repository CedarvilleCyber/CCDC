Short version:

1.  Change root/admin password
2.  Clean ssh
3.  Cron jobs and .bashrc
4.  Load scripts
5.  Security updates (script)
6.  Crete aliases (script?)
7.  Eliminate all weird users
8.  Check for open ports
9.  Eliminate unnecessary services
10. Backups (Script)
11. Setup dovecot/postfix
12. Password policy (script?) https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/FreeIPA_Guide/user-pwdpolicy.html
13. Setup logging (Script?)
 
Long version:
1.  Change root/admin password
        su root
        passwd
        su Administrator
        passwd
2.  Clean ssh
        Remove all ssh keys from root and Administrator user home dirs (~/.ssh/authorized_keys)
        Now may also be a good time to shut down port 22: iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 22 -j DROP
3.  Cron jobs and .bashrc
        Make sure there are no cron jobs scheduled in:
            /etc/crontab
            /etc/cron.dayly/
            /etc/cron.hourly/
            /etc/cron.monthly/
            /etc/cron.weekly/
        Check the root and Administrator .bashrc files for weird commands and scripts
4.  Load scripts
        The git repo probably does not work, add 8.8.8.8 as a source in /etc/resolv.conf
5.  Security updates
        Run da script
6.  Crete aliases
        I like to do this early to make the rest of this easier
7.  Eliminate all weird users
        You should see all the users that were pre-configured for the competition and the users in users.png (In this repo)
8.  Check for open ports
        Use nmap to and the ports alias to find ports to block and block them with iptables:
            iptables -A INPUT -p [tcp/udp] --destination-port <port> -j DROP
9.  Eliminate unnecessary services
        sudo systemctl stop <service>
        sudo systemctl disable <service>
10. Backups
        Run da script
11. Setup dovecot/postfix
        Run through the settings and make sure nothing seems weird
12. Password policy
        This is a good thing to start because it takes time and it's always an inject
13. Setup logging
        The Splunk guy should either be able to to this or should have taught you to do it
