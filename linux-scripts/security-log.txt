Attention: Please look over /etc/group carefully for suspicious users.
(Pay special attention to the adm, admin, sudo, root, and wheel groups.
Any user that is in a large number of groups should be investigated.)

Command: sudo less /etc/group

Attention: Please look over /etc/passwd carefully for suspicious users.
(The users in the file are in order of creation. Look for accounts that have 
names of services such as avahi, but that have home directories and login shells 
they should not have. Any user with a home directory or login shell not set to 
false is immediately suspect.)

Command: sudo less /etc/passwd

Attention: Please look over /etc/sudoers carefully for suspicious users.
(The only user specified here should be root and the only groups should be admin
and sudo. In addition, make sure that no one can use sudo without entering a
password.)

Command: sudo less /etc/sudoers

If any suspicious users are found, check with management, and, if 
approved, disable accounts.

Command: sudo usermod -L <account>

Working/home directory: Please check for suspicious files or directories.
