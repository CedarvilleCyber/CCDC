# Logging
The shell scripts present here will configure the splunk server and install splunk universal forwarders.

## Assumptions
The splunk enterprise server is assumed to already be installed before running the [server setup script](setup_server.sh).
The splunk forwarders are not assumed to be installed, but it is assumed the user knows the certificate password created for their server and what operating system their server is running.
